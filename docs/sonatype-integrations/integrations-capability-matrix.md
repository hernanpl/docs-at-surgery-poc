# Integrations Capability Matrix

Our developers are continuously improving and adding new capabilities to Lifecycle integrations. As they develop new capabilities, they are rolled out to the various platforms and deployment options. This document maps which features are currently available with which deployment. If you do not see the supported feature you expect, please submit your request through the [ideas.sonatype.com](https://ideas.sonatype.com) portal.

Integrations to Lifecycle require a license, while Lifecycle integrations with Nexus Repository require a Sonatype Lifecycle or Repository Firewall license and a Nexus Repository Pro license.
