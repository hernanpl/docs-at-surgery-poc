# CI Components

Available on the [GitLab CI/CD Catalog](https://gitlab.com/explore/catalog/sonatype-integrations/components) .

Sonatype CI Components are designed to integrate Sonatype solutions into your GitLab CI/CD pipelines. These components allow you to automate tasks like policy evaluation against your code, generating vulnerability reports, and fetching Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) directly within your CI/CD workflow.

Refer to [GitLab Docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/components/) for more information about CI Components.
