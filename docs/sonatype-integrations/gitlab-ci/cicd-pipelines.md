# CI/CD Pipelines

Available as a Docker image on the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/sonatype/gitlab-nexus-iq-pipeline) .

With Sonatype in your CI/CD pipeline, you can perform policy evaluations against one or more build artifacts, generate reports, scan containers, and fetch and store SBOM files.

GitLab Ultimate users can also create and update the GitLab's Vulnerability Report. See the corresponding course on [Sonatype Learn](https://learn.sonatype.com/learn/courses/108/sonatypes-gitlab-ultimate-integration/lessons) for a video about this feature.

**Note:** You can also scan Docker containers using the [Sonatype Container Security](#UUID-256fe272-31f8-babd-fac3-f39c0503cfae) integration.
