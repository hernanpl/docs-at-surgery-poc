# Continuous Risk Profile

IQ Server monitors the default branch of each repository daily and if a new commit is detected (once per day) IQ Server will perform a source control evaluation, again at the ' **source** ' stage. This keeps the 'source' stage report on the Reports page in IQ Server relatively up to date.
