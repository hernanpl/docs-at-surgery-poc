# Comprehensive License Management in SBOM Manager Legal View

Sonatype SBOM Manager now includes a new *Legal* view, delivering robust license management through integration with Sonatype’s Advanced Legal Pack (ALP). This centralized view helps you identify component licenses within your SBOMs, flag policy issues, and generate detailed reports. It distinguishes between *Effective* , *Declared* , and *Observed* licenses—even when a component has multiple license terms—to provide deeper visibility into your legal obligations.

Available to customers with licenses for SBOM Manager, Sonatype Lifecycle, and ALP, the *Legal* view supports license selection and overrides at the application, organization, and root organization levels. Built-in inheritance rules ensure consistency, while status options like *Selected* , *Overridden* , and *Acknowledged* give you the control and flexibility needed to stay compliant across your software portfolio.
