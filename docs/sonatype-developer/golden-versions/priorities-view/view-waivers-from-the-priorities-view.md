# View Waivers from the Priorities View

## Check for Waivers in the Build Action Column

The *Build Action* column on the Priorities View contains the following possible statuses:

![Priorities_view_with_waivers.png]({{ "/assets/images/uuid-41070b16-e61d-3bd3-0d61-05bbc17b0f4e.png)

If waivers for a violation are in effect, the *Build Action* column displays the status as *Waived* .

The *Suggested Remediation* column shows:

- *Waive Violations* when the violation does not have any upgrade recommendation and they are not reachable.
- The number of waived violations, when **all** violations have been waived. The green *Auto* tab displays, if **at least one** of the violations has been automatically waived.
