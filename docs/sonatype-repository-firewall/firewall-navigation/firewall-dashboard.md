# Firewall Dashboard

The Firewall dashboard displays a summary of Firewall operations and the components in quarantine. These results are sorted by the most recently quarantined component and may be filtered using the summary metrics.

## Summary Metrics

This display lists the number of components monitored in quarantine-enabled repositories.

## Quarantined Components

The quarantine results contain components currently in quarantine across Firewall-enabled repositories.

Navigate the results using the filters or pagination controls. The list is sorted by the Quarantine Time, Threat Level, and Component by default.

Selecting the Quarantine Time, Policy, Component, or Repository columns header changes the sort order of the component list.

Selecting a table row displays the Component Information Panel for that component.
