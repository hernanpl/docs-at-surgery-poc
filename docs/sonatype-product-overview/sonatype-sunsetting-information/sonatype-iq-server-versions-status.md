The table below lists IQ Server releases, the beginning of extended maintenance, and sunset dates. Versions before 2022 are considered sunsetted.

## Why are you sunsetting versions of the Sonatype IQ Server?

Sonatype's mission is to help you develop software fearlessly. An essential part of that mission is regularly examining our solutions to ensure our customers' deployments have dependable, secure, and well-supported capabilities.

Eventually, some of our products will reach the end of their useful life. The Sonatype PDLC is designed to keep us continually improving our products, ensuring that our customers have access to our best features and functionality, and helping us provide quality support services for our features and products.

In line with that, we will be sunsetting the product versions that are out of support per [Sonatypeâ€™s support policy](https://www.sonatype.com/usage/software-support-policy) .

## I am running a sunset version of Sonatype IQ Server; can I still receive support?

Yes -- Support will provide best-effort guidance to help customers adopt suggested alternatives or an upgrade path.

We encourage all our customers to be on supported versions so that bug fixes and product investment toward enhanced features and capabilities are fully leveraged.
