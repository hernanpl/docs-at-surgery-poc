# Sonatype IQ Server Feature Status

**Note:** The Sonatype Product Development Lifecycle (PDLC), including definitions of each stage, is fully defined in [Sonatype Sunsetting Information](#UUID-217b96ec-8a06-93ff-b373-ab40751a5647) For more information about Sonatype Support services, please see [Sonatype's Software Support Policy](https://www.sonatype.com/usage/software-support-policy) .

The Sonatype PDLC is designed to keep us continually improving our products and ensure our customers have access to our best features and functionality. This also helps us provide quality support services for our features and products. To this end, Sonatype will sunset and remove some Sonatype IQ Server features as they become obsolete.
