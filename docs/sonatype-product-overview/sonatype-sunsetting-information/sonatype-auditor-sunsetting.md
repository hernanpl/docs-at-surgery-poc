# Sonatype Auditor Sunsetting

**Note:** The Sonatype Product Development Lifecycle (PDLC), including definitions of each stage, is fully defined in [Sonatype Sunsetting Information](#UUID-217b96ec-8a06-93ff-b373-ab40751a5647) For more information about Sonatype Support services, please see [Sonatype's Software Support Policy](https://www.sonatype.com/usage/software-support-policy) .

The Sonatype PDLC is designed to keep us continually improving our products and to ensure that our customers have access to our best features and functionality. This helps us provide quality support services for our features and products. Sonatype will sunset and remove the product, Sonatype Auditor.

Existing licenses for the classic version of the Auditor should switch to the Sonatype SBOM Manager product.
